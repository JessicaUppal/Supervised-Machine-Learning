# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

This task will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not. 

## Background

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. This task will compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Preprocessing: Convert categorical data to numeric

First a training set has been created from the 2019 loans using `pd.get_dummies()` to convert the categorical data to numeric columns. The same will be done for 2020 loans, also using `pd.get_dummies(). Missing categories will also need to be added into the testing set.

## Consider the models

You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! Write down (in markdown cells in your Jupyter Notebook or in a separate document) your prediction, and provide justification for your educated guess.

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.

## Revisit the Preprocessing: Scale the data

The data going into these models was never scaled, an important step in preprocessing. Use `StandardScaler` to scale the training and testing sets. Before re-fitting the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data, make another prediction about how you think scaling will affect the accuracy of the models. Write your predictions down and provide justification.

Fit and score the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data. How do the model scores compare to each other, and to the previous results on unscaled data? How does this compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.
